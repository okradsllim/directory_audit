# Directory Audit Tools

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts developed as part of my involvement in the Documentation Audit Task Force at [Your Organization]. The goal of this task force was to audit current and legacy documentation across different units and develop a plan for effective documentation management that aligns with organizational standards.

## Scripts

### Step1.py

**Functionality**: 
- Traverses a specified directory.
- Collects metadata about all files and folders within the directory, allowing for the exclusion of specified folders.
- Outputs the collected data to an Excel file, which includes both a raw data view and a hierarchical view of directories and files.

**Key Features**:
- Exclusion of user-specified folders during the audit process.
- Error logging to handle and track exceptions during runtime.
- Outputs metadata to an Excel file using `pandas` and `openpyxl`, formatted for easy analysis and further processing.

### Step2.py (In Development)

**Intended Functionality**:
- Processes an Excel file generated by `Step1.py` which includes user-defined actions for files and folders (such as move, rename, or delete).
- Executes these actions based on the input provided in the Excel file, allowing for a dynamic and customizable approach to file management.

**Key Features** (Planned):
- Parsing of Excel to read actions and perform them on the filesystem.
- Safety checks to ensure actions are valid and do not result in data loss.
- Detailed logging of actions performed and any issues encountered.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and writing to Excel.
- `openpyxl`: To handle Excel files.
- `os` and `shutil`: For file system operations.
- `logging`: To handle logging throughout the script.

## Local Development

**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and `win32security` (if running on Windows) packages installed.

**Running the Scripts**:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/directory-audit-tools.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd directory-audit-tools
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```
4. Run Step1.py:
   ```bash
   python Step1.py
   ```
5. After generating the Excel file with Step1.py and updating it with desired actions, run Step2.py:
   ```bash
   python Step2.py
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the functionality of these scripts are welcome, especially as we look to fully implement `Step2.py` with robust error handling and user-friendly features.
